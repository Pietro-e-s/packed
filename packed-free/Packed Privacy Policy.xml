All the 3rd parties softwares distributed with the script file (from here on “acting file,” as it produces changes to the system) are not to be intended in any way relatable to the developer. You are free to chose, in the .txt files, which software to install, therefore License contracts, TOSes and Privacy Policies are between the 3rd party software developers and you. This program acts as a “program-fetcher, and does nothing else than that. All data that you use in the various programs and in the Operative System of your choice are not retained in any way bythe developer. This is applicable also for data manipulation and retainage, exception is to basic package installation in inherence with the Operating System.

I, the developer access NONE of your data and therefore cannot distribute it to third parties.</paragraph>
